Solutions for the problems in Eloquent JavaScript 3rd edition


To run the js file and view the output, you can either:

## H2 1. Create a html file and add the following code to it
```html
<html>
<head>
<title></title>
</head>
<body>

<script>
<script src="wherever_your_js_file_is_located_relative_to_the_html_file"></script>
</script>
</body>
</html>
```
The results will be displayed in the browser console(press Ctrl + Shift + I or F12 to open console).

## H2 2. Run it via node(preferred). 
To do that make sure that you have node installed on your machine. To see if Node is installed, open the Windows Command Prompt, Powershell or a similar command line tool, and type node -v . This should print a version number, so you'll see something like this v0.10.35 .

If its not installed, download the latest stable version from https://nodejs.org/en/.
Open cmd or terminal and run youfile.js with node.

Run the javascript file by typing

node youfile.js
