/*
Reversing an array
Arrays have a reverse method that changes the array by inverting the order in
which its elements appear. For this exercise, write two functions, reverseArray
and reverseArrayInPlace. The first, reverseArray, takes an array as argument
and produces a new array that has the same elements in the inverse order. The
second, reverseArrayInPlace, does what the reverse method does: it modifies
the array given as argument by reversing its elements. Neither may use the
standard reverse method.

*/


//Function that will create a new array with the given array's elements in reverse order

function reverseArray(arrayToReverse) {

  let reversedArray = [];

  if (arrayToReverse.length > 0) {

    for (let newIndex = 0, index = arrayToReverse.length - 1; index >= 0; index--) {

      reversedArray[newIndex++] = arrayToReverse[index];

    }
    console.log(reversedArray);

  }
}


//Function that will modify the original array

/*
Pure functions live in a timeless realm. The whole notion of time, of actions happening in some order, doesn't apply to pure functions.
They don't care about time. When you look at pure functions, read the code, debug, test or use just them â€” you don't have to think about time,
about what happened before and will happen after. This is liberating, and all the "easier" things about pure functions are consequences of this fact.
